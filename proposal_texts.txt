Hey Jesse,

It's been a while and I'm just sending the message which is a long shot, given your involved in of the tech industry maybe you might be able to help me catch something. I recently started getting into software development and started doing the coding bootcamp.

I’m nearing the end of my coding bootcamp and have the opportunity to build a project during the upcoming month.

As a junior software developer, I’m interested to work on software related problems or projects for you, your company or any potential person who would be interested in collaboration. 

The stack I am familiar with is:
-Python programming for Automation, Data Science and Data Analysis
-SQL and Relational Databases
-Backend Web Development
-Git and effective collaboration

I would be happy to hear your ideas and see is what is possible. 

Regards,



Michael

Hey,

I'm starting to get into software development.

I am wondering if there is a Melbourne slack channel for python developers. 

If you can help you would be greatly appreciated. 

Regards,

Michael
